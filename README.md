# Starting the bot

    Open a command line instance in the root directory of the bots code, then run the command "npm i nodemon -g" (only need to do this once, this installs nodemon globally)
    Open run.bat

# Adding new commands

If you want to add commands, add the following code into line 23 or below in handler.js:
    
    case "<command name>":
     variable.client.commands.get('<command name>).execute(<variables you want to export>)
     break;

Then create a file named <command name>.js in the commands directory and put the following code in it:

    module.exports = {
        name: <command name>,
        description: "",
        execute(<variables to import>) {

        }
    }
